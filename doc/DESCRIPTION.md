A puppeting bridge between Matrix and Facebook packaged as a YunoHost service. Messages, notifications (and sometimes media) are bridged between a Facebook user and a Matrix user. Currently the Matrix user can NOT invite other Matrix user in a bridged Facebook room, so only someone with a Facebook account can participate to Facebook group conversations. The ["Mautrix-Facebook"](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/facebook/index.html) bridge consists in a Synapse App Service and relies on postgresql (mysql also possible). Therefore, [Synapse for YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/synapse_ynh) should be installed beforehand.
