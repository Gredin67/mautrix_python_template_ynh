> *This package allows you to install Mautrix-Facebook quickly and simply on a YunoHost server.  
If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.*

## Overview
A puppeting bridge between Matrix and Facebook packaged as a YunoHost service. Messages, notifications (and sometimes media) are bridged between a Facebook user and a Matrix user. Currently the Matrix user can NOT invite other Matrix user in a bridged Facebook room, so only someone with a Facebook account can participate to Facebook group conversations. The ["Mautrix-Facebook"](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/facebook/index.html) bridge consists in a Synapse App Service and relies on postgresql (mysql also possible). Therefore, [Synapse for YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/synapse_ynh) should be installed beforehand.

**Shipped version:** 0.3.0

## List of known public services

* Ask on one of the following rooms: #mautrix_yunohost:matrix.fdn.fr or #facebook:maunium.net

## Bridging usage
** Note that several Facebook and Matrix users can be bridged, each Facebook account has its own bot administration room. If they are in a same Facebook group, only one matrix room will be created. **

### Bridge a Facebook user and a Matrix user
* First your Matrix user or Synapse Server has to be authorized in the Configuration of the bridge (see below)
* Then, invite the bot (default @facebookbot:yoursynapse.domain)
  * If the Bot does bot accept, see the [troubleshooting page](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/troubleshooting.html)
* Type ``!fb login <email> <password>``, where ``<email>`` and ``<password>`` are your Facebook email and password, e.g. ``!fb login gafam@evil.com facebookpwd``
* If you have 2FA enabled, the bot will ask you to send the 2FA token.
* By defaults, only conversations with very recent messages will be bridged
* Accept invitations to the bridged chat rooms
* Send ``!fb help`` to the bot in this new Mautrix-Facebook bot administration room to know how to control the bot.
See also [upstream wiki Authentication page](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/facebook/authentication.html)

### Double puppeting
* First login as described in the previous section
* Connect to the Matrix-Synapse Server to get an access token, for example with the command ``curl -XPOST -d '{"type":"m.login.password","identifier":{"type": "m.id.user", "user": "matrixusername"},"password":"matrixpassword","initial_device_display_name":"mautrix-facebook"}' https://yoursynapse.domain/_matrix/client/r0/login``
* Send ``login-matrix <access token>``, where ``<access token>`` is the token received from the Server.
* After logging in, the default Matrix puppet of your Facebook account should leave rooms and your account should join all rooms the puppet was in automatically.


### Relaybot: Bridge a group for several Matrix and several Facebook users to chat together

## Configuration of the bridge

The bridge is [roughly configured at installation](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mautrix_facebook_ynh/blob/master/conf/config.yaml), e.g. allowed admin and user of the bot. Finer configuration can be done by modifying the
following configuration file with SSH: 
```/opt/yunohost/mautrix_facebook/config.yaml```
and then restarting the mautrix_facebook service.

## Documentation

 * Official "Mautrix-Facebook" documentation: https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/facebook/index.html
 * Matrix room (Matrix Bridges in Yunohost): #mautrix_yunohost:matrix.fdn.fr
 * Matrix room (upstream app): #facebook:maunium.net
In case you need to upload your logs somewhere, be aware that they contain your contacts' and your phone numbers. Strip them out with 
``| sed -r 's/[0-9]{10,}/ðŸ“ž/g' ``
 * YunoHost documentation: If more specific documentation is needed, feel free to contribute.

## YunoHost specific features

#### Multi-user support

* Bot users are not related to Yunohost users. Any Matrix account or Synapse server autorized in the configuration of the bridge can invite/use the bot. 
* The Facebook bot is a local Matrix-Synapse user, but accessible through federation (synapse public or private).
* Several Facebook and Matrix users can be bridged with one bridge, each user has its own bot administration room. 
* If several bot users are in a same Facebook group, only one Matrix room will be created by the bridge.
* See https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/synapse_ynh#multi-users-support

#### Multi-instance support

* Multi-instance installation should work. Several bridge instances could be installed for one Matrix-Synapse instance so that one Matrix user can bridge several Facebook accounts. 
* Several bridge instances could be installed for each Matrix-Synapse instance to benefit from it. But one bridge can be used by users from several Matrix-Synapse instances.

#### Supported architectures

* x86-64 - [![Build Status](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/logs/mautrix_facebook%20%28Apps%29.svg)](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/apps/mautrix_facebook/)
* ARMv8-A - [![Build Status](https://ci-apps-arm.yunohost.org/ci/logs/mautrix_facebook%20%28Apps%29.svg)](https://ci-apps-arm.yunohost.org/ci/apps/mautrix_facebook/)

## Limitations

* It looks like media are not bridged.

## Developer info

**Only if you want to use a testing branch for coding, instead of merging directly into master.**
Please send your pull request to the [testing branch](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mautrix_facebook_ynh/tree/testing).

To try the testing branch, please proceed like that.
```
sudo yunohost app install https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mautrix_facebook_ynh/tree/testing --debug
or
sudo yunohost app upgrade mautrix_facebook -u https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mautrix_facebook_ynh/tree/testing --debug
```

To test communication between the App Service and Matrix-Synapse on a VM (e.g. with domain name: synapse.vm), you must install a certificate:
```
echo | openssl s_client -showcerts -servername synapse.vm -connect synapse.vm:443 2>/dev/null | awk '/-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----/, /-----END CERTIFICATE-----/' >> /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/synapse.vm.crt
update-ca-certificates
```
